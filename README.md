# Purpose

This project is used for crypting sensitive text for transmission via a censored instant messaging service.

It is available in folder `crypt` and is designed to run exclusively on Windows.

# Prospect

I am planning to integrate proxying capabilities, also adding multi-platform support. (folder `proxy`)

## Going to finish

 - HTTP/SOCKS protocols.

 - Functions of golang package "[net.TCPConn](https://cs.opensource.google/go/go/+/go1.21.4:src/net/tcpsock.go;l=112)".

 - Debugging processes through [gdb](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/gdb/index.html) & [ddd](https://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/manual/html_mono/ddd.html).
