# Purpose

Previously, I worked on a project when I first started learning C/C++. The aim was to encode sensitive text for transmission via a censored instant messaging service. This project is available in the `history` and is designed to run exclusively on Windows.

# Prospect

I am planning to integrate networking capabilities.

## UNSOLVED
