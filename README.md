# Purpose

This project is used for crypting sensitive text for transmission via a censored instant messaging service.

It is available in folder `crypt` and is designed to run exclusively on Windows.

# Prospect

I am planning to integrate proxying capabilities, also adding multi-platform support. (folder `proxy`)

## Going to finish

 - Debugging processes through [gdb](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/gdb/index.html).

 - Functions of golang package "[net](https://pkg.go.dev/net)"; net.TCPConn.
